# Data Structures I

_Algoma University   |   Dec 2021_

An introduction to linear data structures and their associated algorithms. The course is organized around the concept of Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and their implementation as Java classes. Pointers and dynamic memory. Treatment of stacks, queues and linked lists. Searching and sorting algorithms. Analysis of algorithm time and space requirements. The connection between these topics and principles of Software Engineering is emphasized.
